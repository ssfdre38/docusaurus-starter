## Configurging Amp to see RedBot

First thing you need to do is to add my GitHub Repo to your panel.
Go to your panel and then go to Configuration > Instance Deployment and then add my repo in Configuration Repositories.
You will press add and add this to it

```bash
ssfdre38/AMPTemplates:dev
```
And press Fetch Latest.

There you will go back to the Instances page on the main part of your AMP Panel and then you will see.

```bash
