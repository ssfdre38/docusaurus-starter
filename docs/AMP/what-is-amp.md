# What is AMP?

AMP (Application Managment Panel) is built by [CubeCoders](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) as the predecessor of McMyAdmin after the owner saw that it can do and be more.
It can host more then just [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) and is built to be as lightweight as possible.
It's built using C++ and Knockout.js but is closed source and built for Linux and Window Systems.

# How much does it cost?

AMP is a one time cost depending on what type of license you get. For Standard Edition it can cost $10 with Professional costing $20 and the Advanced license costing $40. These are all a One Time cost and is a Lifetime license. You can view more at the [Cubecoders AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) site.

# What if I want to sell Game Servers using AMP?

AMP does have an Enterprise License that is a monthly cost depending on what you need. It does come with Dedicated support from Cubecoders and WHMCS support.
